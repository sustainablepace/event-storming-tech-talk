# Event Storming Tech Talk

## Why Event Storming

Value is in interaction between people

## Prerequisites

- all key stakeholders in the room (those with questions, those with answers)
- unlimited modelling space
- stickies and pens for everyone
- no tables or chairs, no phones or computers

## How To

- Domain Events
- Timeline
- Edge Cases

## Scopes

- Big Picture
- Process Modelling
- Software Design

Explain relation to Cynefin
- Redundancy
- Chaos
- Throw away the model

## Big Picture

### Identify

- Conflicts
- Pain points
- Goals
- Where money is earned
- Blockers
- Bottlenecks
- Boundaries

### With

- Events
- Hot Spots
- Systems
- People

### Value

- Big Picture
- Interactions and conversations
- Learning the business domain
- Decision enabler, Buy or make? Manual workarounds possible?
